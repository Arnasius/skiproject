**Model designs**

UML conceptual model is done with MagicDraw software, it does look a little bit different from the design taught in the lectures, however I was using it to create models in my university back in Lithuania (Erasmus student here).

Did my best to keep the relationship between conceptual, logical and physical designs true.
